## Use Cases

**Host hosts game**  
Adult or person setting up the game navigates to the website. Upon arrival, they see a large "Host Game Button".  

**Host gets room code**  
The host is presented with a short room code that they will tell the players so they can enter it and join.  

**Host presses start game button**  
Once everyone has joined, the host will press start game. This will trigger the beginning of the game cycle.  

**Kids enter room code**  
Children use the room code provided by the host to enter it and join the lobby. They may require some assistance from the host depending on physical or cognitive limitations.  

**Kids select avatar**  
Upon joining, each player will be presented with an array of avatars to choose from, and they must tap an avatar to join the lobby with that avatar.  

**One player is selected at random to be a drawer**  
Out of all players, including the host, one is randomly selected to be the first drawer. They will be shown the drawing interface.  

**The drawer is given 3 random choices to choose from to draw**  
The drawer is provided with 3 random prompts to choose from to draw. They tap on the choice that they want, and then they can begin drawing.  

**Guessers see an AAC tablet and drawing as it progresses**  
The guessers spectate the drawing and make guesses using the AAC tablet as the round progresses. There is a timer counting down during each drawing phase.  

**Phase ends when the timer expires or everyone has guessed correctly**  
At this point, the correct answer will be displayed, and players will be awarded points. Point award values have not been determined yet.  

**Players are awarded points for guessing correctly, drawer is awarded for players guessing the drawing**  
Players will accumulate points based on their performance in the game, but we want to make sure that the game doesn't feel too competitive.  

**Everyone draws 3 times, then users see summary screen**  
This is our current concept for a full game. After everyone draws for their third time, total points will be displayed, and rankings will be shown at the end of the game.
