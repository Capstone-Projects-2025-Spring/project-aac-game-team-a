## Use Cases

Host hosts game<br>
Adult or person setting up the game navigates to the website. Upon arrival they see a large "Host Game Button".<br>
<br>
Host gets room code<br>
The host is presented with a short room code that they will tell the players so they can enter it and join.<br>
<br>
Host presses start game button<br>
Once everyone has joined, the host will press start game. This will trigger the beginning of the game cycle.<br>
<br>
Kids enter room code<br>
Children use the room code provided by the host to enter it and join the lobby. They may require some assistance from the host depending on physical or cognitive limitations.<br>
<br>
Kids select avatar<br>
Upon joining, each player will be presented with an array of avatars to choose from, and they must tap an avatar to join the lobby with that avatar.<br>
<br>
One player is selected at random to be a drawer<br>
Out of all players, including the host, one is randomly selected to be the first drawer. They wil be shown the drawing interface.<br>
<br>
The drawer is given 3 random choices to choose from to draw<br>
The drawer is proivided with 3 random prompts to choose from to draw. They tap on the choice that they want, and then they can begin drawing.<br>
<br>
Guessers see an aac tablet and drawing as it progresses<br>
The guessers spectate the drawing and make guesses using the AAC tablet as the round progresses. There is a timer counting down during each drawing phase.<br>
<br>
Phase ends when the timer expires or everyone has guessed correctly.<br>
At this point, the correct answer will be displayed and players will be awarded points. Point award values have not been determined yet.<br>
<br>
Players are awarded points for guessing correctly, drawer is awarded for players guessing the drawing<br>
Players will accumulate points based on their performance in the game, but we want to make sure that the game doesn't feel too competitive.<br>
<br>
Everyone draws 3 times, then users see summary screen<br>
This is our current concept for a full game. After everyone draws for their third time, total points will be displayed and rankings will be shown at the end of the game.<br>
