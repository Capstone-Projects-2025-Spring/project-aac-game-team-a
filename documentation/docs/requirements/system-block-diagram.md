**Figure 1.** High-level design of Scribblers! web application.

## Description
The system diagram shown in Figure 1 shows the architecture of the Scribblers application at a high-level.
AAC and Non-AAC Users access the game through the same webpage interface. 
The webpage is rendered by the React front-end framework, handling user inputs and updating the webpage with game data processed by the back-end. 
The back-end, hosted on a server running Node.js, processes any data received from the front-end and handles external API calls as needed.
