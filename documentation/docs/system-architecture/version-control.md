# Version Control
This project maintains version control with GitHub. The main branch is protected and requires at least one approver to merge changes.

Features and updates are added under new branches, where code can be modified, tested, and verified by another team member before merging. For changes linked to a Jira issue, the following format is used for naming a new branch:
'AGTA-XXX-Issue-Summary'
where 'XXX' is the issue number. This allows for automation of Jira workflow.
